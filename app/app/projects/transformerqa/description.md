This model solves the reading comprehension model task. It is similar to the
proposed model in [Devlin et al](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52967399),
with improvements borrowed from the SQuAD model in the
[transformers project](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

This model is maintained by the AllenNLP team and its contributors on the AllenNLP
models repository at [https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models).

It achieves 88% F1 and 84% exact match on the SQuAD 2.0 validation set.
